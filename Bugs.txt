Bugs that are in the Bot right now:

Fixed Bot is despondent after TPing most of the time(Bot moves after the first hit? Death resets the bot and makes it work)

Fixed Tping would make following false, so after 1 second it can work

Fixed
!!!Cannot break blocks if they take too long
Added "    if(bot.pathfinder.isMining()) console.log("mining rn")" which fixed it, don't know why or how
Guess: Using console.log and checking it creates lag that allows the bot to mine?
